python im made with websocket
Pim, also known as Python Instant Messager, is an aim-style chatroom intended to be done by the end of SOM, so like a couple days. i will be using python for the websocket, so wish me luck. NOTE: BECAUSE I DONT HAVE A HOST, YOU WILL NEED TO SET UP THE SERVER BY RUNNING THE PYTHON PROGRAM ALSO YOU MIGHT NEED FLASK
to run the thingy follow these directions: <br>
1: Make a folder called templates, then place the html inside it.<br>
2: Make a folder called static, then put the css inside it.<br>
3:run the python from the terminal<br>
4:follow the link to the localhost.<br>
