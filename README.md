python im made with websocket
Pim, also known as Python Instant Messager, is an aim-style chatroom intended to be done by the end of SOM, so like a couple days. i will be using python for the websocket, so wish me luck. NOTE: BECAUSE I DONT HAVE A HOST, YOU WILL NEED TO SET UP THE SERVER BY RUNNING THE PYTHON PROGRAM
